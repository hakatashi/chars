# chars

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hakatashi/chars.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/hakatashi/chars)

Split strings into array of characters by ‚ÄúSemmantically-correct‚Äù way.

This module inspired by [esrever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esrever).

## Why not just use `string.split('')`!?!?!?!?

Well, [esrever's README](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/esrever#why-not-just-use-stringsplitreversejoin)
sufficiently explains why, but I can simply answer that
**the chars of JavaScript is not just the chars of Unicode.**

In Unicodes, a pair of surrogates constitutes (In other word, ‚Äúexpresses‚Äù) one character by itself.
In JavaScript, thanks to [the UCS-2-like behavior,](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/javascript-encoding)
the pair is treated as two characters.

```js
> 'ùüôùüöùüõ'.split('')
[ 'ÔøΩ', 'ÔøΩ', 'ÔøΩ', 'ÔøΩ', 'ÔøΩ', 'ÔøΩ' ]
```

And what is worse, if you reverse strings by famous `.split('').reverse().join('')` trick,
you may even get wrong character by joining partial surrogate pairs.

```js
> 'ùüôùüöùüõ'.split('').reverse().join('')
'ÔøΩùüöùüôÔøΩ' // Huh?
```

OK, now ‚Äúchars‚Äù is here for you. Instead of using `string.split('')`,
you can gracefully use `chars(string)` at ease.

```js
> chars('ùüôùüöùüõ').reverse().join('')
'ùüõùüöùüô' // Gotcha!
```

‚Äúchars‚Äù recognizes **surrogate pairs** and **other Unicode mechanisms**
to split strings into array of characters. Be like a boss, y'all!

### But sorry!

If you just want something to recognize *only* surrogate pairs to
split strings into array of characters,
**you already have it** as an ES6 feature.

```js
> Array.from('ùüôùüöùüõ').reverse().join('')
'ùüõùüöùüô'
```

## Usage

    $ npm i chars

```js
const chars = require('chars');

chars('cafe\u0301'); // -> ['c', 'a', 'f', 'e\u0301']

// All features are on by default.
// You can switch off some specific features by option.
chars('cafe\u0301', {combiningMark: false}); // -> ['c', 'a', 'f', 'e', '\u0301']

// You can also get detailed information about each character.
chars('cafe\u0301', {detailed: true});
/* -> [ { type: [], char: 'c', broken: false },
        { type: [], char: 'a', broken: false },
        { type: [], char: 'f', broken: false },
        { type: [ 'combiningMark' ], char: 'eÃÅ', broken: false } ] */
```

## Mechanisms

Currently this module recognizes the following mechanisms of Unicode.

* [Surrogate Pairs](#surrogate-pairs)
* [Combining Marks](#combining-marks)
* [IDS](#ids-ideographic-description-sequences)

### Surrogate Pairs

Read the section [above](#why-not-just-use-stringsplit).

Parsing surrogate pairs is basic functionality of this module and
you cannnot turn this feature off by option.
If you don't need even this feature, use `string.split('')`.

### Combining Marks

Some Unicode characters works as ‚Äúmodifier‚Äù and append additional parts
to the preceding character. These characters should be semantically one combined character.

Example:

```js
> chars('deÃÅpoÃÇt')
[ 'd', 'eÃÅ', 'p', 'oÃÇ', 't' ]
```

You can turn this feature off by `{combiningMark: false}`.

### IDS (Ideographic Description Sequences)

Ideographs used in east asia are very complex and mostly they can be described by
composition of another ideographs.

Unicode supports description of these composition by special meta-characters,
which is called ‚ÄúIDC (Ideographic Description Characters).‚Äù
They constitute some character sequences by simple algorithm and
express single character whose parts are represented by another character.

Semantically they are one ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù with a bunch of portion.
[Unicode Standard 8.0.0 describes](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode8.0.0/ch18.pdf)
how these sequences should be interpreted programatically.

> Ideographic Description characters are not combining characters,
and there is no requirement that they affect character or word boundaries. Thus U+2FF1
U+4E95 U+86D9 may be treated as a sequence of three characters or even three words.
>
> Implementations of the Unicode Standard may choose to parse Ideographic Description
Sequences when calculating word and character boundaries. Note that such a decision will
make the algorithms involved significantly more complicated and slower.

Then, this module _choosed_ to parse IDS as character.

Example:

```js
> chars('‚ø±Â•≥‚ø∞Â•≥Â•≥„Åó„ÅÑ')
[ '‚ø±Â•≥‚ø∞Â•≥Â•≥', '„Åó', '„ÅÑ' ]
```

You can turn this feature off by `{ids: false}`
